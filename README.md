Hello there,

Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm thrilled to connect with fellow enthusiasts who share a passion for AI, Python, R, data science, algorithmic trading, and distributed systems. My name is erma0x, and I am deeply immersed in these exciting fields.

Artificial Intelligence has always fascinated me, and I have delved into its various facets, from machine learning to natural language processing and computer vision. Exploring cutting-edge algorithms and applying them to solve real-world problems has been a truly rewarding experience for me.

Python and R have been my trusted allies in this journey. The versatility, simplicity, and extensive libraries of both languages have empowered me to develop powerful data analysis pipelines, build predictive models, and create insightful visualizations. Whether it's extracting insights from complex datasets or developing robust machine learning models, I find immense joy in harnessing the potential of these languages.

In addition to my passion for AI and data science, I have a deep interest in algorithmic trading. The intersection of finance and technology presents a unique opportunity to leverage AI and quantitative strategies to make informed investment decisions. I enjoy exploring various trading algorithms, backtesting strategies, and implementing automated trading systems.

Furthermore, I am fascinated by the scalability and efficiency of distributed systems. Building solutions that can handle large-scale data processing, distributed machine learning, and real-time analytics is a challenge I eagerly embrace. By harnessing the power of distributed computing, I aim to unlock the full potential of AI and data science in handling complex, high-volume datasets.

On my GitHub, you will find a diverse collection of projects, code snippets, and experiments that reflect my passion for AI, Python, R, data science, algorithmic trading, and distributed systems. I believe in the power of open-source collaboration and knowledge sharing. I hope my contributions can inspire and assist fellow developers, traders, and data scientists in their endeavors.

Feel free to explore my repositories, delve into the code, and provide feedback or suggestions. Let's connect, collaborate, and together push the boundaries of AI, Python, R, data science, algorithmic trading, and distributed systems.

🧬 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 in Biotechnology and Computational Biology

I have had the privilege to pursue my academic journey at the CIBIO Department of Cellular, Computational and Integrated Biology at the University of Trento. During my time there, I focused on various projects and achieved the following milestones:

Conducted data analysis of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for genetic associations in prostate cancer using R, Python, and SQL.
Developed proficiency in database management systems, including MariaDB, SQLite, MySQL, and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Redis.

🦠 𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗿 in Biotechnology at the University of Trento

My undergraduate studies in Biotechnology at the University of Trento provided a strong foundation in several key disciplines, including molecular biology, genetics, mathematics, informatics, physics, and statistics. This comprehensive curriculum allowed me to gain a multidisciplinary understanding of the field.

📚 **Thesis**: "Machine Learning Methods Applied to Computational Biology and Biomedicine"

As part of my academic journey, I completed a thesis titled "Machine Learning Methods Applied to Computational Biology and Biomedicine."
