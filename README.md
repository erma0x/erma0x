## Ermano Buikis


### 💻 ꜱᴜᴍᴍᴀʀʏ
Self-taught developer with a great passion for programming
and with large collection of projects derived from personal projects, freelancing, university and internship.

Fast learner, creative and challenge seek

I've done projects related to: machine learning, GUI creation, image processing,
