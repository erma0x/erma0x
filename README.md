### 💻 ꜱᴜᴍᴍᴀʀʏ
Self-taught developer with a great passion for programming
and with large collection of projects derived from personal projects, freelancing, university and internship.
Fast learner, creative and challenge seeker.


I've done projects related to: machine learning, GUI creation, image processing,
data preprocessing, algorithm building, software design, email
processing, ETL (big data experience with 500GB + database),
automation of the software and activity planning with Python, R, SQL and JS.

I am looking for a company that sees the potential
