Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm thrilled to connect with all of you who share a passion for AI, Python, R, data science, algorithmic trading, and distributed systems. My name is erma0x, and I'm deeply immersed in these exciting fields.

Artificial Intelligence has always fascinated me, and I've had the opportunity to explore its various facets, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. It's been truly rewarding to delve into cutting-edge algorithms and apply them to solve real-world problems.

Throughout my journey, Python and R have been my trusted allies. The versatility, simplicity, and extensive libraries of both languages have empowered me to develop powerful data analysis pipelines, build predictive models, and create insightful visualizations. Whether it's extracting insights from complex datasets or developing robust machine learning models, I find immense joy in harnessing the potential of these languages.

In addition to my passion for AI and data science, I have a deep interest in algorithmic trading. The intersection of finance and technology provides a unique opportunity to leverage AI and quantitative strategies for making informed investment decisions. I enjoy exploring various trading algorithms, backtesting strategies, and implementing automated trading systems.

Moreover, I'm fascinated by the scalability and efficiency of distributed systems. Building solutions that can handle large-scale data processing, distributed machine learning, and real-time analytics is a challenge I eagerly embrace. By harnessing the power of distributed computing, I aim to unlock the full potential of AI and data science in handling complex, high-volume datasets.

On my GitHub, you'll find a diverse collection of projects, code snippets, and experiments that reflect my passion for AI, Python, R, data science, algorithmic trading, and distributed systems. I strongly believe in the power of open-source collaboration and knowledge sharing. I hope my contributions can inspire and assist fellow developers, traders, and data scientists in their endeavors.

Feel free to explore my repositories, delve into the code, and provide feedback or suggestions. Let's connect, collaborate, and together push the boundaries of AI, Python, R, data science, algorithmic trading, and distributed systems.

During my academic journey at the CIBIO Department of Cellular, Computational and Integrated Biology at the University of Trento, I had the privilege to pursue an Internship in Biotechnology and Computational Biology. I focused on various projects and achieved significant milestones. For example, I conducted data analysis of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for genetic associations in prostate cancer using R, Python, and SQL. Through this experience, I developed proficiency in database management systems, including MariaDB, SQLite, MySQL, and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Redis.

Additionally, my undergraduate studies in Biotechnology at the University of Trento provided a strong foundation in key disciplines such as molecular biology, genetics, mathematics, informatics, physics, and statistics. This comprehensive curriculum allowed me to gain a multidisciplinary understanding of the field.

As part of my academic journey, I completed a thesis titled "Machine Learning Methods Applied to Computational Biology and Biomedicine." This research delved into the intersection of machine learning and computational biology, leading to innovative approaches for solving complex problems in biomedicine. It allowed me to further explore my areas of interest and contribute to the growing field of computational biology.

These milestones represent my dedication to the fields of biotechnology, computational biology, and machine learning. Through my experiences and projects, I've developed a strong skill set in data analysis, programming languages, and the application of advanced techniques to biological and biomedical research.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page, and I look forward to connecting with you!

Best regards,
