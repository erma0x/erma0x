### 💻 ꜱᴜᴍᴍᴀʀʏ

Self-taught developer with a great passion for programming
and with a large collection of software projects. I had done
software development, devops, data analysis, data exploration,
data visualization with Python, R and SQL with projects, university and internship.
I have done projects related to: machine learning, GUI creation, image processing,
data preprocessing, algorithm building, software design, email
processing, ETL (big data experience with 500GB + database),
automation of the software and activity planning. Creative and
innovative.
I am looking for a company that sees the potential
in me, as I am interdisciplinary and I learn quickly.
